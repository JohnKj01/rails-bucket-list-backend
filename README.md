# The BucketList

The Bucket List is a web application developed using RoR (Ruby on Rails) and React JS. It aims to provide users with a seamless and comprehensive platform where they can effortlessly create, organize, and monitor the progression of their diverse aspirations, goals, and dreams, thereby comprising their esteemed bucket list.
